<h1> About Chester Map Site</h1>
<p>Chester is a city of history and heritage. This site was made by Gemma and Jess. We both moved to Chester in summer 2019 and have been discovering new places
ever since. We hope that your visit to our website has been a good one, this is our first of many websites!

This website was created as part of the curriculum for the CodeFirst:Girls Beginners coding course.
Thank you CodeFistGirls and Bank of America Merrill Lynch for supporting women to get into tech.
